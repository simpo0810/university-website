         <p>Hemenway Gymnasium in the Law School Yard as an optimal location for much-needed fitness facilities. Hemenway was a memorable destination for many alumni, but in recent years the squash facility, which housed 12 American-sized courts, had become obsolete and underutilized. The primary design challenge was that the structural configuration and lack of natural light were not conducive to a fitness centerâ€”especially considering the social role fitness centers play for contemporary students. Sasaki executed an exterior restoration and a gut interior reconfiguration.</p>
